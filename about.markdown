I hope this blog will last long, I had many blogs, but I have deleted them all. Sometimes, I hate what I've written, that is why is go back and delete them all. Everything from this moment soon becomes a part of the history, it may worth reading, sometimes it's just trash, and after years it seems mostly just trash. But from now, I think I should keep it, accept it as a part of the present me and future me.

I'm thinking of setting up the comment feature, but most of the time, I never see anyone give a fuck about what I wrote so that just send me an email if you found this blog interesting.
