As I asked a few people I know in a while, do you have a close friend? A silent moment passed by, and the answer is no.

But why?

And FYI, I'm no longer meet them since the last time we met as we never are friends. I shared my stories but they didn't share, or sharing but carefully cover the detail. I also did care about them sometimes, but I got just a few in return.

Just like all other kinds of relationships, friendship needs giving and taking. I can't expect people to kind to me, so I do my part in the relationship, I give.
